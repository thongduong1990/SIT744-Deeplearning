    "## Assignment objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is for you to demonstrate the knowledge in deep learning that you have acquired from the lectures and practical lab materials. Most P-level tasks in this assignment are straightforward applications of the practical materials in weeks 1-5. Going through these materials before attempting this assignment is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment consists of four sets of tasks with progressive level of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set 1 (P Tasks)\n",
    "- Set 2 (C Tasks)\n",
    "- Set 3 (D Tasks)\n",
    "- Set 4 (HD Tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Set 1 is labeled as P tasks because these demonstrate the minimum requirements of the unit. Concentrate on the P tasks first as these are the foundation for all the rest. As you move through sets 2, 3 and 4, the tasks become more challenging, with each allowing you to obtain the marks required to achieve the next achievement level (C, D, and HD respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking criteria\n",
    "Indicative weights of various tasks are provided below, but your submission will be marked by the following criteria, adjusting for the overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-level expectation\n",
    "- Showing good effort through completed tasks.\n",
    "- Applying deep learning theory to design suitable deep learning solutions for the tasks.\n",
    "- Demonstrating at least ‘Analysis’ level (Level 4) thinking in Bloom’s Taxonomy. This means you should not only implement the tasks but also examine, compare, and interpret results, explaining why certain decisions were made and what patterns or insights are revealed by your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C-level expectation\n",
    "- Showing attention to detail through a good quality assignment report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D-level expectation\n",
    "- Demonstrating creativity and resourcefulness in providing unique individual solutions.\n",
    "- Critically evaluating and reflecting on the pros and cons of various design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD-level expectation\n",
    "- Extending classroom learning to research and tackle previously unexplored theoretical questions or novel applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Warning: Highly similar solutions will be investigated for collusion.)**\n"
