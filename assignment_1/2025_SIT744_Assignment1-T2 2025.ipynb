    "This is an individual assignment. It contributes 20% to your final mark. Read the assignment instructions carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to submit\n",
    "By the due date, you are required to submit the following files to the corresponding Assignment (Dropbox) in CloudDeakin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[YourID]_[UnitCode]_assignment1_solution.ipynb**: This is your Python notebook solution source file.\n",
    "- **[YourID]_[UnitCode]_assingment1_output.pdf**: This is the output of your Python notebook solution exported in PDF format. (You may use [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert).)\n",
    "- (HD Task only) A short (less than 5 minutes) screencast explaining your work (including study design, implementation, and main conclusions).\n",
    "- Extra files required to complete your assignment, if any (e.g., images used in your answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your student ID is: 123456, and you are a SIT744 student, you will then need to submit the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 123456_SIT744_assignment1_solution.ipynb\n",
    "- 123456_SIT744_assignment1_output.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep your answers short and to the point. Clean up your code outputs to reduce unnecessary information (e.g., excessively long training logs).\n",

    "## Assignment objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is for you to demonstrate the knowledge in deep learning that you have acquired from the lectures and practical lab materials in weeks 1-3. Going through these materials before/while attempting this assignment is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment consists of four sets of tasks with progressive level of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set 1 (P Tasks)\n",
    "- Set 2 (C Tasks)\n",
    "- Set 3 (D Tasks)\n",
    "- Set 4 (HD Tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Set 1 is labeled as P tasks because these demonstrate the minimum requirements of the unit. Concentrate on the P tasks first as these are the foundation for all the rest. As you move through sets 2, 3 and 4, the tasks become more challenging, with each allowing you to obtain the marks required to achieve the next achievement level (C, D, and HD respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking criteria\n",
    "Indicative weights of various tasks are provided below, but your submission will be marked by the following criteria, adjusting for the overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-level expectation\n",
    "- Showing good effort through completed tasks.\n",
    "- Applying deep learning theory to design suitable deep learning solutions for the tasks.\n",
    "- Justify design choices.\n",
    "- Identifies potential dataset biases and ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C-level expectation\n",
    "- Showing attention to detail through a structured and detailed assignment report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D-level expectation\n",
    "- Demonstrating creativity and resourcefulness in providing unique individual solutions.\n",
    "- Critically evaluating and reflecting on the pros and cons of various design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HD-level expectation\n",
    "- Extending classroom learning to research and tackle previously unexplored theoretical questions or novel applications.\n",
    "- Critically reflects on the broader implications of deep learning models, including ethical and safety considerations.\n",
